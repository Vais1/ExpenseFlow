Project Overview — ExpenseFlow
Purpose

ExpenseFlow is an enterprise-grade Expense and Reimbursement Approval System designed to digitize, streamline, and govern the full lifecycle of employee expense submissions within an organization.

The system replaces manual, email-based, or paper-driven reimbursement processes with a centralized, role-based platform that ensures transparency, accountability, and efficiency across all stages of expense management.

ExpenseFlow is built with scalability, clarity, and real-world organizational workflows in mind, making it suitable for small teams as well as large enterprises.

Problem Statement

In many organizations, expense reimbursement processes suffer from:

Manual submissions via email or paper

Lack of visibility into approval status

Poor accountability and auditability

Delays caused by unclear approval responsibilities

Inconsistent record keeping

These issues lead to inefficiency, financial inaccuracies, and poor employee experience.

ExpenseFlow addresses these challenges by providing a structured, approval-driven system that enforces clear ownership, permissions, and traceability.

Core Concept

ExpenseFlow operates around a submission → review → approval/rejection model.

Employees submit expense claims.
Managers review and verify claims.
Administrators oversee the system, manage users, and ensure compliance.

Every action in the system is tied to a specific user role and recorded for accountability.
